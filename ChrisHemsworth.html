						<p>Chris Hemsworth is an Australian actor known for playing the role of Thor. He is 39 years old, 6 foot 3 inches tall, and weighs a lean 220 pounds.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Chris was always athletic and grew up playing many different sports. His primary was Aussie Rules Football. He was and still is an avid surfer.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Because of his athletic background, fitness was always a big part of his life, evident in some early movie roles. However, Chris started taking his training seriously when being cast as Thor. At that point, he knew he had to take his routine to the next level to become a real-life superhero.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Luckily, Chris has excellent genetics, so his body took well to his workouts. That said, genetics only take you so far. The rest is dependent on training and eating, which is why we're about to get into all things related to the Chris Hemsworth diet and workout.</p>

					<div class = "label">What is the Chris Hemsworth workout plan & training split</div>
					<div class = "content">
						<p>One of the unique aspects of playing a role like Thor is it requires a combination of size, conditioning, and functional ability. Essentially, you need to look like a bodybuilder while moving around like an athlete.</p>
						<br>
						<p>To accomplish this, Chris followed an old-school bodybuilding training split and supplemented it with full body circuits. Here's a look at the Chris Hemsworth work out plan and split, which follows a 5-day training schedule.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Chris Hemsworth's Bodybuilding Training Split:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Back</li>
							<li>Chest</li>
							<li>Legs</li>
							<li>Shoulders</li>
							<li>Arms</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						<p>For the Chris Hemsworth workout program, Chris hit each muscle once per week with short but intense workouts. The bodybuilding routine focused on traditional compound movements using heavy weights and moderate to high volume. This means lots of squats, bench presses, rows, pull-ups, chin ups, and deadlifts.</p>
