            <p class = "lead">Chris Evans' Captain America Training</p>
            <div class = "article-columns">
                <p>Here, we'll be exploring the exact workouts that Evans used to gain upper-body brawn and transform from an affable wimp to a villain-crushing, armed-and-dangerous warrior. While impressive, Evans' objective of crafting a frame that would strike fear into even the most wretched Marvel villains was an unenviable one, and would see him supersetting a tough workout with an even more regimented diet plan, making the most of lean protein sources, smart supplementation and a trainer that knew his way around Hollywood's toughest alums.</p><br>
                <p>As you can expect, the "byproduct of being an athlete" is just wellness shorthand for the end result of months of rigorous training, hundreds of thousands of reps and total commitment to a role. What's more, Evans wasn't equipped with the typical Hollywood-grade training facility loaded with next-gen tech. Instead, his fitness mecca was no more complex than a high street commercial gym or fitness centre. "The gym wasn’t anything too special,” he said in his Men's Health cover interview ahead of Captain America's release. "We would take two muscle groups, whether it was chest and back or biceps and triceps and we would just destroy those muscles, literally, for about two hours. Then we’d cool down with core and abs."</p><br>
                <p>By hitting the muscle groups from multiple angles, Waterson's smart programming kept Evans' muscles constantly stimulated, leaving no muscle fibre untorn. "I had no idea there were so many ways you could burn yourself out," said Evans of Waterson's muscle alchemy. Even more appealing, however, was the duo's approach to dreaded cardio. Or, more fittingly, the lack of. During his three-month prep to become Captain America — at the start of which, Evans admitted to being "pretty skinny" — he never worked through a jot of cardio. Zilch. Zip. Nada. "If I do cardio I’ll disappear,” he said. "I just needed to gain size." And that, reader, is what he did. Here's how.</p>
