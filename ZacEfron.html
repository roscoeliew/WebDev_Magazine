                <h1>Who is Zac Efron</h1>
                <p>Zac Efron is really a millennial icon. Having started his acting career in school theater class he went on to guest star in several television series including Firefly, ER, and The Guardian. Inevitably this lead to his first full-time role in the second season of Summerland.</p>
                <br>
                <p>That sort of initial success and his on-screen charisma lead to his breakout role in Disney Channel’s High School Musical. He became instantly recognizable among the teenage and younger crowd who are now entering their various stages of adulthood now.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The High School Musical Trilogy really laid the foundation for Efron’s career and he’s had steady work ever since in a variety of roles as he’s diversified himself in Hollywood.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The most iconic, for our purposes, is his role as Matt Brody in Baywatch. For the role, Efron seemingly transformed his body into the quintessential Men’s Physique Competitor’s body type. It was the most shredded the world had ever seen him.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Since, he’s become a fitspiration for a lot of people with his Instagram workout posts and his YouTube series “Gym Time”.</p>

                    <p>Keep your rest periods relatively short throughout each workout. 45-60 seconds in between supersets should do the trick.</p>

                        <h1>Zac Efron's Diet and Nutrition</h1>
                        <p>If you’re looking to get shredded like Zac Efron in Baywatch, you’re going to want to get your nutrition in check as well.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Anytime losing body fat is the main goal, you will need to eat in a caloric deficit. This includes knowing what your daily maintenance calorie consumption should be and subtracting roughly 500 calories from this number.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>To keep yourself satiated, once you have your fat loss calorie needs figured out, you’ll want to consume a diet that’s both high in protein and relatively high in fiber. For the most part, this will be a diet predominately made up of whole foods and lean protein sources.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>For this particular role, and to lose water weight for that shredded look, it would make sense that Zac probably took on a temporary keto diet plan. This protocol was probably followed by dehydration leading into shirtless scenes.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>However, this isn’t a smart approach for most people. Your body thrives on carbohydrates and you’re likely not getting paid millions to get shredded to your core.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Instead, focus on a more sustainable approach. Figure out your calories and fill those needs with food sources such as lean protein, whole grains, rice, oats, nuts, seeds, fruits, vegetables, and low or non-fat dairy.</p>
