                    <h2>Hugh Jackman's Workout: Strong, Lean & Powerful</h2>
                    <p>Hugh Jackman’s physical transformation over the past years has made him one of the most impressive Hollywood physiques to cross the red carpet in the last decades. The role of Wolverine in the X-Men series is perhaps the most responsible for his physical transformation. Hugh first took on the role of Wolverine in 1999 and has transformed his body dramatically for the role on and off since then. His most dramatic transformation took place in X-Men Origins: Wolverine.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>To transform his physique for the 2009 film, Jackman worked for over 6 months to pack on muscle and transform himself into the impressive image of Wolverine we all know. I say all of this to make sure that I give credit where credit is due. The road to Hugh’s transformation was a long journey that required consistency and hard work. During the height of his training, Hugh was training over two hours a day seven days a week with cardio and weight training.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>To find out the specifics of his workout, you can view his trainer David Kingsbury’s blog. When observing someone else’s workout, remember that it is made specifically for them. In other words, for accomplishing their goals, addressing their weaknesses, taking into consideration their timeline, and utilizing the time they have available during the week to train. In Hugh Jackman’s case, he exercised for more than 14 hours each week. That’s a part time job. Most people do not have 14 hours to train or a deadline they must meet or risk losing millions of dollars.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>You can still learn from Hugh Jackman’s training and use it to reach your goals and have a physique that turns heads. You must look beyond the exercises, sets and reps schemes and view the underlying principles that his workout is based upon and apply them to your own training.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>After deconstructing Jackman’s workout, here are the underlying principles and factors that allowed him to attain and maintain a superhero's physique.</p>
