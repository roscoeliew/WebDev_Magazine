                        <h1>Who is Tom Holland?</h1>
                        <p>Tom Holland is an English actor best known for his portrayal of Peter Parker A.K.A Spider-Man in the Marvel Cinematic University. Beginning his acting career in musicals, Holland’s breakthrough role was in the 2012 thriller ‘The Impossible’, starring Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor. Holland won a string of awards for his role in the film, including the Hollywood Film Festival Spotlight Award and nominations for best newcomer.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Moving into the Marvel universe, Holland has starred as Peter Parker, the high-schooler turned friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man, in five Marvel movies to date. Using his athletic background in dance, Tom Holland has transitioned nicely into the Superhero role and gained praise for his athletic prowess by co-stars and producers alike. Natural talent aside, Holland still had to put in some serious work to play the role, including a muscle building diet and gruelling weightlifting circuit</p>

                        <h1>Spirderman Diet</h1>
                        <p>You can do all the weights in the world, your muscles won’t grow unless you give them the right fuel. In conjunction with his intensive daily workout circuit, Holland had to prioritise his nutrition to ensure he hit his muscle-building goals.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>But on top of the kilo-a-week muscle gain required, Holland also needed to maintain a single figure body fat percentage for key shirtless scenes within the film. To achieve this muscle-building, fat-shredding objective, Holland needed a lean-bulk nutrition plan without enough carbs to fuel his workouts.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Ashwell chose to build on the actor’s regular diet, adjusting quantities and nutrients as required, rather than prescribe a set meal plan. The result was a ‘two fist’ bulking plan.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>While we don’t know a whole lot about what Tom Holand eats on the daily, it’s fair to say his activity level is extremely high. With a mix of explosive movements and aerobic fitness, the calorie intake has to be significant, with a vast amount of protein filtered throughout. According to Men’s Journal, each meal in the Tom Holland diet plan contained:</p>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Two fist-sized portions of protein</li>
                            <li>Two fist-sized portions of carbohydrates</li>
                            <li>Two fists of greens</li>
                        </ul>
